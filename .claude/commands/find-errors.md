description: Find and analyze all errors in the job research system
---

Scan the entire job research system codebase for errors, issues, and potential bugs.

Please perform the following tasks:

1. Check for TypeScript compilation errors in both backend and frontend:
   - Backend: `/Users/samarmustafa/Documents/1Samar/50-apps-to-launch/RE-BUILT-WITH/cursor/cv-match/job-research-system/job-research-mcp`
   - Frontend: `/Users/samarmustafa/Documents/1Samar/50-apps-to-launch/RE-BUILT-WITH/cursor/cv-match/job-research-system/job-research-ui`

2. Check for runtime errors in the backend server logs

3. Check for console errors in the frontend application

4. Identify any missing dependencies or configuration issues

5. Look for common code issues:
   - Missing imports
   - Undefined variables
   - Type mismatches
   - Syntax errors
   - Missing files referenced in code

6. Provide a summary report with:
   - Total number of errors found
   - Categorized list of errors (compilation, runtime, type errors, etc.)
   - Priority level for each error (critical, high, medium, low)
   - Recommended fixes for each error

Please be thorough and scan all relevant files in the codebase.
